The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is a powerful tool to explain the atomic world, it can be solved by \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods accurately; however, they require massive computational resources. In recent times, machine learning techniques have been proven to be flexible and efficient in approximating functions and are widely used in many fields, including quantum chemistry. Given a trained machine learning model, it can predict quantum properties of molecules in several orders of magnitude faster than the \textit{ab initio} methods. Here we present machine learning techniques which only have small computational cost and require small amount of samples to learn the quantum properties of a set of molecular coordinates. Several machine learning models include but not limited to combined supervised--unsupervised kernel, molecular level kernel, and atomic level kernel are employed. The QM9 dataset is chosen as a benchmark for the machine learning techniques. With only 100 samples for training, 1 kcal/mol chemical accuracy is almost achieved across the whole 130k test samples.
